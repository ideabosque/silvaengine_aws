# Dynamic GraphQL Engine (SilvaEngine) with Routing Dispatch Layer 

## Synopsis
The SilvaEngine, our advanced GraphQL engine, boasts a remarkable capability to deliver multiple versions of functions through the routing dispatch layer, making GraphQL the primary API in our system. This cutting-edge feature allows us to efficiently manage various versions of functions, ensuring seamless compatibility and flexibility for our users and developers.

By leveraging the power of the SilvaEngine, we can effortlessly roll out new updates and enhancements to functions while ensuring backward compatibility with existing versions. This enables us to cater to a wide range of clients, each with their specific requirements, without sacrificing performance or data integrity.

Moreover, the routing dispatch layer acts as a robust mediator, intelligently directing incoming requests to the appropriate function versions, optimizing response times, and ensuring optimal resource utilization. This architectural elegance translates to a superior user experience and faster time-to-market for new features.

In summary, the SilvaEngine's ability to manage multiple function versions through GraphQL has revolutionized the way we deliver and maintain our APIs. It epitomizes our commitment to technological excellence, user-centricity, and adaptability in an ever-evolving digital landscape.

## Architecture

### The Routing Layer:
Our robust Routing Layer is constructed using [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) function resources and [AWS DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) tables. This intelligent combination enables seamless determination of the specific Python module and function to invoke, while also applying the necessary settings during each engagement.

By leveraging AWS Lambda's auto-scaling capabilities, our system effortlessly adapts to varying workloads, ensuring optimal performance and cost-efficiency. This dynamic scaling guarantees a smooth user experience even during peak usage periods.

Integrating AWS DynamoDB empowers us to maintain a centralized repository of configurations and settings, allowing real-time updates and easy retrieval of routing information. This flexibility enables us to quickly adapt to changes and deliver tailored solutions for different use cases.

In essence, our Routing Layer stands as a cornerstone of our platform, utilizing cutting-edge AWS technologies to provide intelligent function invocation and personalized settings, reaffirming our commitment to delivering scalable, efficient, and customer-centric solutions.

### The Business Dispatch Layer:
At the heart of our system lies the Business Dispatch Layer, which operates through an [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) function called **workers**. This layer efficiently handles incoming requests by dispatching them to the appropriate Python module and function. The response generated by our GraphQL implementation, built with [**graphene-python**](https://graphene-python.org/), is then returned to the user.

To manage the underlying data layer effectively, we rely on [AWS DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/), a scalable and reliable NoSQL database service. To interface with DynamoDB effortlessly, we utilize [**pynamodb**](https://pynamodb.readthedocs.io), a robust and user-friendly Python library.

By utilizing AWS Lambda for request dispatch and implementing GraphQL with **graphene-python**, we ensure a streamlined and high-performing experience for our users. The integration of AWS DynamoDB via **pynamodb** further enhances our system's efficiency, enabling seamless data storage, retrieval, and management.

In summary, the Business Dispatch Layer epitomizes our commitment to cutting-edge technologies and thoughtful design, enabling us to deliver efficient, scalable, and user-centric solutions for a wide range of applications.

# Dynamic GraphQL Engine (SilvaEngine) with Routing Dispatch Layer 

## Synopsis
The SilvaEngine, our advanced GraphQL engine, boasts a remarkable capability to deliver multiple versions of functions through the routing dispatch layer, making GraphQL the primary API in our system. This cutting-edge feature allows us to efficiently manage various versions of functions, ensuring seamless compatibility and flexibility for our users and developers.

By leveraging the power of the SilvaEngine, we can effortlessly roll out new updates and enhancements to functions while ensuring backward compatibility with existing versions. This enables us to cater to a wide range of clients, each with their specific requirements, without sacrificing performance or data integrity.

Moreover, the routing dispatch layer acts as a robust mediator, intelligently directing incoming requests to the appropriate function versions, optimizing response times, and ensuring optimal resource utilization. This architectural elegance translates to a superior user experience and faster time-to-market for new features.

In summary, the SilvaEngine's ability to manage multiple function versions through GraphQL has revolutionized the way we deliver and maintain our APIs. It epitomizes our commitment to technological excellence, user-centricity, and adaptability in an ever-evolving digital landscape.

## Architecture

### The Routing Layer:
It is built with an [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) function **resources** and [AWS DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) tables to determine which python module and function will be invoked and apply the setting during an engagement.

### The Business Dispatch Layer:
An [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) function **workers** will dispatch the requests to the python module and function and return the response generated by GraphQL built by [**graphene-python**](https://graphene-python.org/) with the data layer ([AWS DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/)) managed by [**pynamodb**](https://pynamodb.readthedocs.io).

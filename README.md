### The Routing Layer:
It is built with an [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) function **resources** and [AWS DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) tables to determine which python module and function will be invoked and apply the setting during an engagement.

### The Business Dispatch Layer:
An [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) function **workers** will dispatch the requests to the python module and function and return the response generated by GraphQL built by [**graphene-python**](https://graphene-python.org/) with the data layer ([AWS DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/)) managed by [**pynamodb**](https://pynamodb.readthedocs.io).
